# Humanoid-Static-WBC
Humanoid walking with whole body control involves the coordinated management of all joints and limbs to achieve a stable walking motion.
* Footstep generation
* Center of Mass(CoM) trajectory Planning
* Foot trajectory planning
* Quadratic Programming (QP) Controller to track the above trajectories.
* Finite State Machine (FSM) to coordinate between the different states of
the movement.
